# Hybrid-Neural-Network-and-Simulated-Annealing-Algorithm-for-Optimizing-Wideband-Patch-Antenna
In this project, the ANN is trained on a dataset obtained from the high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS) to model the nonlinear relationship between the antenna's geometric parameters and its S-parameters. The SA algorithm is then employed to broaden the bandwidth of the patch antenna with a desired center frequency.
